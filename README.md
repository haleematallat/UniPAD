# UniPAD: A Universal Pre-training Paradigm for Autonomous Driving

UniPAD is a novel self-supervised learning framework designed for 3D perception tasks in autonomous driving. Inspired by the paper *UniPAD: A Universal Pre-training Paradigm for Autonomous Driving*, this repository implements key components of UniPAD, including modular encoders for LiDAR and multi-view images, a unified volumetric representation, and a neural rendering decoder.

---

## **Overview**

UniPAD leverages a unique self-supervised pre-training strategy based on 3D differentiable rendering. It learns rich geometric and semantic representations from both LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images, enabling significant improvements in downstream tasks such as 3D object detection and semantic segmentation.

Key features include:
- **Mask Generator**: Strategically masks input data to enhance representation learning.
- **Modal-Specific Encoders**: Extracts features from LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images.
- **Volumetric Representation**: Transforms features into a unified 3D voxel space.
- **Neural Rendering Decoder**: Produces continuous geometric and semantic predictions.
- **Memory-Efficient Ray Sampling**: Optimizes training efficiency with minimal memory overhead.

---

## **Implemented Features**
- Modular design for encoders (LiDAR and image modalities) and decoders.
- Neural rendering for RGB and depth prediction.
- End-to-end training and evaluation scripts.
- Support for the nuScenes dataset or other point cloud and image datasets.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UniPAD.git
   cd UniPAD
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### **1. Dataset Preparation**
Prepare the dataset (e.g., nuScenes):
- Store LiDAR point clouds in `datasets/nuscenes/lidar`.
- Store corresponding images in `datasets/nuscenes/images`.

### **2. Training**
Train the model using the `examples/3d_detection.py` script:
```bash
python examples/3d_detection.py
```

### **3. Evaluation**
Evaluate the model using the `examples/segmentation.py` script:
```bash
python examples/segmentation.py
```

## **Key Components**

### **Mask Generator**
A strategic masking mechanism for both point cloud and image modalities to enhance model generalization.

### **Encoders**
- **LiDAREncoder**: Processes 3D point cloud data.
- **ImageEncoder**: Extracts features from multi-view image data using a convolutional backbone.

### **Decoder**
The **NeuralRenderingDecoder** uses volumetric rendering techniques to predict RGB or depth values.

## **Results**
This implementation aims to replicate the improvements reported in the paper, such as:
- +9.1 NDS for LiDAR-based detection.
- +7.7 NDS for camera-based detection.
- +6.9 NDS for LiDAR-camera fusion.

(Note: Fine-tuning may be necessary to achieve optimal performance.)
